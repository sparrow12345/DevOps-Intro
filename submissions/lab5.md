## Task 1: Vagrant Up + Run QuickNotes Inside

- [**Vagrant File**](https://github.com/sparrow12345/DevOps-Intro/blob/feature/lab5/Vagrantfile)

- **First 10 output lines:**

- **`curl` output:**

- **Design questions:**

  - **Vagrant supports nfs, rsync, virtualbox, and smb mount types. Which did you pick and why? What's the trade-off?**

    I used the default `virtualbox` shared folder. It's bidirectional and host edits appear in the guest instantly, needs no extra host tooling. The trade-off: VirtualBox shared folders have slower I/O than native disk and depend on Guest Additions matching the kernel. `rsync` would be faster to read inside the guest but is a one-way, point-in-time copy and host changes don't propagate until `vagrant rsync`, which is wrong for an edit-rebuild loop. `nfs`/`smb` are faster for large trees but add a daemon and a `sudo` host dependency, overkill for one small `app/` folder.

  - **Which network mode are you using (it's the default, but say which it is)? Why is 127.0.0.1-bound port forwarding safer than a Bridged interface for a course exercise?**

    The default is `NAT` with port forwarding. `127.0.0.1`-bound forwarding is safer than a Bridged interface because the guest port is reachable only from the host, nothing on the LAN/Wi-Fi can reach it. A Bridged interface puts the VM directly on the physical network with its own IP, exposing QuickNotes (which has no auth) to every device on the network.

  - **Vagrant supports shell, ansible, ansible_local, puppet, chef, … which did you pick for installing Go and why?**

    I used the `shell` provisioner. Installing go and writing one systemd unit is a handful of commands but using Ansible/Puppet/Chef would be an over kill for this simple app.

  - **Why pin Go to a specific point release (1.24.5) instead of 1.24?**

    `1.24` is a floating minor that resolves to whatever the latest patch is *the day we provision* two students (or the same student next month) could get different compilers, so builds aren't reproducible and a regression in a new patch
    could silently break the VM. Pinning the exact point release `1.24.5` makes `vagrant up` deterministic.

## Task 2: Save, Break, Restore

- **Save:**

- **Break + Verify:**

  ![Break VM](src/lab05_snapshot_break.png)

- **Restore:**

  ![Restore snapshot](src/lab05_snapshot_restore.png)

- **Verify:**

  ![Verify snapshot restore](src/lab05_snapshot_verify.png)

- **Design questions:**

  - **What failure modes is a snapshot useless for?**

    A snapshot lives on the same disk with the VM, so it's useless if the disk of the hosting device breaks, get infected with a ransomware or get stolen ...
    A snapshot is just a rollback point on the live volume, to go back to certain timestamp in the VM's life.

  - **Vagrant snapshots are copy-on-write under VirtualBox. What does that mean for disk usage when you take 10 snapshots vs 1?**

    Under VirtualBox a snapshot freezes the current disk and writes only subsequent changes to a differencing image. So 10 snapshots don't cost 10× the VM size, each costs only the delta written between it and the next, plus a little metadata.
    Also taking a snapshot is near-instant and cheap, the cost grows with how much you change afterward, not with how many snapshots you hold.

  - **When is snapshotting an antipattern?**

    Long snapshot chains. Every read has to walk the chain of differencing images, so deep chains slow disk I/O and balloon storage as deltas accumulate, a corrupt link can invalidate everything after it. Snapshots are for short-lived "checkpoint before a risky change, then commit or roll back" use, not as a backup strategy, a version-control substitute, or something you let pile up for weeks.
